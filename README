README: earthclock

A nice clock showing the earth. It's only really nice on Unix, and
only if you have X11::Protocol and xearth installed. Instead of
xearth, you can fetch images directly from the internet.

INSTALLATION

    perl Makefile.PL
    make all test install

You can also start the program simply by typing

    perl earthclock

There is a cgi script named xearth.cgi which can serve the xearth
image for workstations without the xearth.cgi program. To use it on
the client side, you have to change the URL to the CGI in the
earthclock script (search for "change the URL for the xearth.cgi here").
